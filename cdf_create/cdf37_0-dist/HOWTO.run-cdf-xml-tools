Instructions for using the CDFML utilitites 
-------------------------------------------
- Use the CDF2CDFML Java program to create a CDF Markup Language (CDFML) 
  document, XML representation of a CDF file, from a CDF file. 

  To get the instructions and valid arguments/options, enter:
       java CDF2CDFML (at the operating system prompt)

- Use the CDFML2CDF Java program to convert a CDFML document into a CDF file. 

  To get the instructions and valid arguments/options, enter:
       java CDFML2CDF (at the operating system prompt)


NOTE:
   If one creates a CDFML file from an existing CDF file and creates a new
   CDF file from that CDFML file, the contents of the new file is the same 
   as the original CDF file.  But the ordering of some of the variable 
   attributes in the new file could be different from the original file 
   that should be transparent to the users.
