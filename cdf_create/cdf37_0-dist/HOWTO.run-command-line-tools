Below is a list of the CDF command line utilities (a.k.a. CDF toolkit) included
as part of the CDF distribution package.  Java version of the command line
utilities are also included as part of the CDF distribution package, and their
use is recommended over the command line version since they are much more
intuitive and easier to use.  The HOWTO.run-Java-tools file describes how to
use the Java version of CDF tools.

To invoke any of the utilities listed below, just type the name of the program
of interest at the operating system prompt.  This will display a brief 
description of the program and the help information as to how to use the 
program on the screen.

cdfcomapre 
     This utility is used to display a directory listing of a CDF's files. 
     The .cdf file is displayed first followed by the rVariable files and 
     then the zVariable files (if either exist in a multi-file CDF) in 
     numerical order. 

cdfconvert 
     This program is used to convert various properties of a CDF. In all 
     cases new CDFs are created (existing CDFs are not modified.) Any 
     combination of the following properties may be changed when converting 
     a CDF. 

       - A CDF created with an earlier release of the CDF library (e.g., CDF 
         V2.5) may be converted to the current library release. 
       - The format of the CDF may be changed. 
       - The data encoding of the CDF may be changed. 
       - The variable majority of the CDF may be changed. 

cdfdir 
     This program displays a directory listing of a CDF's files.

cdfedit 
     This program allows the display and/or modification of practically all 
     of the contents of a CDF by way of a full-screen interface. It is also 
     possible to run CDFedit in a browse-only mode if that's desired. 

cdfdump 
     This program dumps the data contents of a CDF file, one variable at a
     time.  Output is more human readable than the format produced by cdfexport.

cdfexport 
     This program allows the entire contents or a portion of a CDF file to be 
     exported to the terminal screen, a text file, or another CDF. The 
     variables to be exported can be selected along with a filter range for 
     each variable which allows a subset of the CDF to be generated. 
     When exporting to another CDF, a new compression and sparseness can be 
     specified for each variable. When exporting to the terminal screen or 
     a text file, the format of the output can be tailored as necessary. 

cdfinquire 
     This program displays the version of the CDF distribution being used and 
     the default toolkit qualifiers. 

cdfmerge
     This program merges two or more CDF files into a single CDF.  Typing
     cdfmerge alone will display the help message.

cdfstats 
     This program produces a statistical report on a CDF's variable data. 
     Both rVariables and zVariables are analyzed. For each variable it 
     determines the actual minimum and maximum values (in all of the variable 
     records), the minimum and maximum values within the valid range (if the 
     VALIDMIN and VALIDMAX vAttributes and corresponding entries are present 
     in the CDF), and the monotonicity. An option exists to allow fill 
     values (specified by the FILLVAL vAttribute) to be ignored when 
     collecting statistics. 

skeletonTable 
     This program is used to create an ASCII text file called a skeleton table 
     containing information about a given CDF (SkeletonTable can also be 
     instructed to output the skeleton table to the terminal screen.) It reads 
     a CDF file and writes into the skeleton table the following information. 

        1. Format (single or multi file), data encoding, variable majority. 
        2. Number of dimensions and dimension sizes for the rVariables. 
        3. gAttribute definitions (and gEntry values). 
        4. rVariable and zVariable definitions and vAttribute definitions 
           (with rEntry/zEntry values). 
        5. Data values for all or a subset of the CDF's variables. 
           Traditionally, only NRV variable values are written to a skeleton 
           table. RV variable values may now also be written. The above 
           information is written in a format that can be "understood" by the 
           SkeletonCDF program. SkeletonCDF reads a skeleton table and creates 
           a new CDF (called a skeleton CDF). 

skeletonCDF 
     This program is used to make a fully structured CDF, called a skeleton 
     CDF, by reading a text file called a skeleton table. The skeleton table 
     contains the information necessary to create a CDF that is complete in 
     all respects except for record-variant (RV) var iable values. (RV 
     variables vary from record to record.) RV values are then written to the 
     CDF by the execution of an application program. The SkeletonCDF program 
     allows a CDF to be created with the following. 

        1. The necessary header information - the number of dimensions and 
           dimension sizes for the rVariables, format, data encoding, and 
           variable majority. 
        2. The gAttribute definitions and any number of gEntries for each. 
        3. The rVariable and zVariable definitions. 
        4. The vAttribute definitions and the entries corresponding to each 
           variable. 
        5. The data values for those variables that are non-record-variant 
           (NRV). NRV variables do not vary from record to record.

cdfirsdump
     This program is used to dump out the Internal Records (in hex) of a CDF
     file. A CDF file consists of a number of Interal Records. Refer to the
     CDF Internal Record Description Document for detail. This is a tool
     mainly used for file diagnostics. 

cdfvalidate
     This program is used to validate a CDF file or files. It checks whether 
     a file is a valid CDF file and if it contains any bad data.

cdfmerge
     This program combines several CDF files into one. Normally, it merges a
     master CDF, which has only metadata, with other CDFs that contain 
     variable data.
